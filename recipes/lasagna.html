    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is one of the most classic and comforting dishes in Italian cuisine, known for its generous layers of pasta stacked with flavorful sauce, melted cheese, and a variety of fillings. Traditionally made with Bolognese sauce and plenty of mozzarella, it blends textures and flavors in a harmonious way, resulting in a rich and satisfying meal. Its preparation takes time and care, but the final result is worth it: a creamy, golden, aromatic dish that pleases everyone and becomes the highlight of any table, whether for family lunches or special occasions.</p>

        <li>500g ground beef</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 garlic gloves, minced</li>
        <li>1 can of peeled tomatoes</li>
        <li>½ cup tomato sauce</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon oregano</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped parsley or cilantro</li>
        <li>1 package of pre-cooked lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>300 g sliced mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>200 g sliced ham</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to make it</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a pan</li>
        <li>Add the chopped onion and sauté until golden</li>
        <li>Add the garlic and ground beef, and cook until the meat is fully browned</li>
        <li>Once the meat is cooked, add the canned tomatoes and sauté a little longer</li>
        <li>In a baking dish, start layering: a layer of sauce, then lasagna noodles, then ham, mozzarella, and more sauce</li>
        <li>Repeat the layers until you run out of ingredients</li>
        <li>Finish with a layer of sauce and plenty of grated Parmesan cheese on top</li>
        <li>Bake in a medium oven (around 350F or 180C) until the lasagna is bubbly and the cheese on top is melted and lightly golden</li>
        <li>Lei it rest for a few minutes before slicing - this helps the lasagna hold its shape</li>
    </ol>
